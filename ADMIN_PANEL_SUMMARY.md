### Documentation

- ✅ Added setup instructions and troubleshooting guide
- ✅ Documented API endpoints and security considerations

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
The database has been recreated with the new schema. An admin user has been created with:
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Email**: `admin@kurakani.com`
- **Password**: `admin123`
- **Full Name**: `System Administrator`

### 2. Start the Application
```bash
# Start backend
cd Backend
uvicorn main:app --reload

# Start frontend (in another terminal)
cd "Project 6th"
npm start
```

### 3. Access Admin Panel
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/login`
2. Log in with admin credentials
3. Click the "Admin" link in the navbar or go to `http://localhost:3000/admin`

## 🚨 GitHub Access Issue

### Current Status
The admin panel implementation is complete and working locally, but there's a permission issue pushing to the GitHub repository:

```
remote: Permission to AryanJung/Kura_Kani-.git denied to NisanRana.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/AryanJung/Kura_Kani-.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
```

### Solutions

#### Option 1: Fork the Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/AryanJung/Kura_Kani-
2. Click "Fork" to create your own copy
3. Update the remote URL:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Kura_Kani-.git
   git push origin admin-panel
   ```

#### Option 2: Use Personal Access Token
1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
2. Generate a new token with repo permissions
3. Use the token in the remote URL:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/AryanJung/Kura_Kani-.git
   git push origin admin-panel
   ```

#### Option 3: Request Repository Access
Contact the repository owner (AryanJung) to grant you write access to the repository.

### Recommended Approach
**Option 1 (Fork)** is recommended as it's the safest and most common approach for contributing to repositories you don't own.

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Resolve GitHub access** using one of the options above
2. **Test the admin panel** thoroughly with different user roles
3. **Consider additional features** like:
   - Audit logging for admin actions
   - More granular permissions
   - Admin activity dashboard
   - User activity monitoring

## 🐛 Testing

To test the admin panel:
1. Create a regular user account
2. Verify they cannot access `/admin`
3. Log in as admin user
4. Verify all admin features work correctly
5. Test user management actions
6. Verify security restrictions (can't modify own status)
